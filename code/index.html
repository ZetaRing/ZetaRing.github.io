<h2 id="bio">Brief Bio</h2>
<p>When I watched the famous movie "The Matrix" for the first time, I was deeply attracted by the artificial intelligence described in the film.
  After that, I made up my mind that I would create such "creatures" one day. <br>
  In my college days, I spent much time learning everything about computer science crazily.
  As an attempt, I conducted my favorite project, "<a href="#SMART" style="color: blue;"><u>SMART</u></a>."
  I also earned the opportunity to go to MSRA to learn cutting-edge technology about deep learning.<br>
  After I graduated, I joined Microsoft as an SDE (Bill Gates is a legend in our time). 
  Although I did a great job in the company and earned myself a comfortable life,
  I can't stop asking myself whether this is my dream. <br>
  On my badge, it writes, "Empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more."
  Thus, I left Microsoft and gave up a high salary and comfortable life for my dream. I joined the Institute of Neuroscience to study how our brain works. 
  In the institute, I considered a lot about what intelligence is and how to build artificial general intelligence from the neuroscience perspective. <br>
  Now I am here, I am ready to turn my dream into reality.
