<h2 id="bio">Brief Bio</h2>
<p>When I watched the famous movie "The Matrix" for the first time, I was deeply attracted by the artificial intelligence described in the film.
  After that, I made up my mind that I would create such "creatures" one day. <br>
  In my college days (2015-2019), I spent much time learning everything about computer science crazily.
  As an attempt, I conducted my favorite project, a life-long learning framework, "<a href="#SMART" style="color: blue;"><u>SMART</u></a>."
  I also earned the opportunity to go to <b>Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA)</b> in 2018 to learn cutting-edge technology about deep learning.<br>
  After I graduated, I joined <b>Microsoft</b> as an SDE in 2019 (Bill Gates is a legend in our time). 
  Although I did a great job in the company and earned myself a comfortable life,
  I can't stop asking myself whether this is my dream. <br>
  On my badge, it writes, "Empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more."
  Thus, I left Microsoft and gave up a high salary and comfortable life for my dream. I joined <b>the Institute of Neuroscience</b> to study how our brain works in 2020. 
  In the institute, I considered a lot about what intelligence is and how to build artificial general intelligence from the neuroscience perspective. <br>
  Now I am here, I am ready to turn my dream into reality.

<h2 id="plan">Research Proposal</h2>
<img src="./plan.png">
<p>
  My long-term research goal is to build an agent that can learn, create, and communicate like human
beings. By integrating perception, action, and language under a unified framework, <b>embodied
agents</b> can lead us toward this ultimate goal of computer science. With an interdisciplinary
background in computer science and neuroscience, I can make a unique contribution to this area.

<pre class="highlight"><b>
Here is a brief ascending hierarchical description: <br>
1. Transformers - An Agent That Is Suitable for Any “Body”<br>
2. The Blind Men and the Elephant - Perception & Multimodality<br>
3. Crystallized Intelligence - Long-term Memory<br>
4. The Imitation Game<br>
5. Mary in the Room - Embodied Experience<br>
6. Language, Neuro-symbolic, and Time Travel<br>
7. What’s the Meaning of the Agent’s Life - Target Function<br>
8. Where Is the Boundary – Inherent Bias and Knowledge Acquisition<br>
9. An Agent Without Soul - Beyond Intelligence<br>
